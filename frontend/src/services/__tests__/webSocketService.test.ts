// Basic test documentation for WebSocketService
/*
This is a placeholder test file for WebSocketService.

In a complete implementation, we would test:

1. Connection establishment:
   - WebSocket connects to the specified URL
   - onopen event is triggered correctly
   - Connection status is updated

2. Message handling:
   - onmessage event receives data correctly
   - Message parsing works for valid JSON
   - Error handling for invalid JSON
   - Different message types are handled correctly:
     * new_block
     * new_transaction
     * peer_update

3. Event subscription:
   - subscribe method adds listeners correctly
   - unsubscribe method removes listeners correctly
   - emit method calls subscribed listeners
   - Error handling in listeners doesn't break other listeners

4. Message sending:
   - send method formats messages correctly
   - send method only sends when connected
   - Messages are serialized to JSON correctly

5. Reconnection logic:
   - Reconnection attempts are made on disconnect
   - Reconnection interval is respected
   - Max reconnection attempts are enforced
   - Successful reconnection resets attempt counter

6. Disconnection:
   - disconnect method closes the connection
   - onclose event is handled correctly
   - Connection status is updated

7. Error handling:
   - Connection errors are caught and emitted
   - Message errors are caught and logged
   - Invalid states are handled gracefully

Example test structure:

describe('WebSocketService', () => {
  let webSocketService: WebSocketService;
  const mockUrl = 'ws://localhost:8080';

  beforeEach(() => {
    webSocketService = new WebSocketService(mockUrl);
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    webSocketService.disconnect();
  });

  describe('connect', () => {
    it('should establish a WebSocket connection', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });

  describe('send', () => {
    it('should send a message when connected', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });

  // Additional test suites...
});
